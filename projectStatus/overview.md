     - [x] Loading states with fallbacks
     - [x] Error recovery strategies
   - [x] Optimistic updates
     - [x] Task status changes
     - [x] Task deletion
     - [x] Toast notifications
     - [x] Error recovery
   - [x] Integration tests
     - [x] Testing environment setup
     - [x] API mocking with MSW

## Current Focus
- Improving accessibility
- Adding final polish
- Documentation and cleanup

## Next Steps
1. Improve accessibility:
   - Add ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
2. Add final polish:
   - Loading animations
   - Transition effects
   - Mobile responsiveness
3. Documentation and cleanup:
   - API documentation
   - Component documentation
   - Code cleanup

## Technical Decisions
- Using node-postgres (pg) for direct database operations
- Implementing MVC pattern for API organization
- NextAuth.js for authentication with JWT
- ShadCN for UI components
- Tailwind for styling
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation
- Date-fns for date formatting and manipulation
- Recharts for data visualization
- Vitest and Testing Library for integration tests
- MSW for API mocking
